**About**
The main idea of this program is to deprive you of all the **repetitive labor** while editing your videos.


**Settings**
You can either choose the **custom mode** and choose all your settings manually. 
Or you can choose the **automatic mode** to analyze some of your previous videos and calculate the settings.

**Editing**
Once everything is setup you can start automatically editing your videos  and stop losing your time doing labor :wink:
